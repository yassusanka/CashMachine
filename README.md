# CashMachine
A simple cash account <-> bank system implementation (very loosely modelled!)

This project uses JavaFX for the user interface toolkit. JavaFX is a software platform for creating 
and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich Internet applications (RIAs) 
that can run across a wide variety of devices. It is part of the standard Java distribution.

Welcome to your first App. "ZipCloudBank", a local Wilmington fintech startup, has a minimally
viable product in CashMachine. The response from customers has been, shall we say, underwhelming.
The original coder has gone off to another startup, in Thailand, where they code on surfboards
all day long.
The Board of Directors of ZipCloudBank have empowered me to let you take a crack at "upping their game"
and improving their app over this weekend. Impressed that you are a ZipCode student, they are
expecting great things. Don't panic: we think you can do this.

The point of this lab is to read thru some existing code, in this case, a program/app that 
launches a window on your computer and lets you play with a couple of "banking accounts".
You should run the app, learn how to use it, so you understand what it does. It is not,
shall we say, user-friendly. So you may find what you have to do to make it work somewhat
awkward.

Then, you should read thru the code repository seeing how the code actually implements the 
things you see when you run the code. Find the "main" routine, which is where the app 
starts up. Trace from there to see what code gets called where and when. Trace how the 
operations of the code work.

Finally, you are to add some new functionality to the app, to make it "more useful, powerful &
more rewarding for the user".  
Your effort will be met with promotions, parades, and stock options. (no, just kidding).

## Lab Brief

Notice the structure of the current project before you start. Read thru the 
code up here on git.zipcode.rocks.
Read thru the code. READ THRU THE CODE.

## Now, Switch across to the [README.TXT](README.TXT) file to see what you need to do for this lab.

NB:
When googling for information on how to do all this, be sure you start every query with "javafx " and your other search terms. That will limit the results to things that probably are closer to what you need.
